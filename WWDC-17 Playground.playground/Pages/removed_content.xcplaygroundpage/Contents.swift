 First, let's talk about huamn brains. Our brain is made out of trillions of trillions of neurons. Each neuron recieves information, process them and return some output. After hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, our human brain became one of the most complex and beautiful creation of the universe. Inspired by our brain, computer scientists are trying to simulate the workings of neural networks on computers. With sufficient understanding of human brain and enough computer power, artificial neural networks have the potential of learning and solving problems.
