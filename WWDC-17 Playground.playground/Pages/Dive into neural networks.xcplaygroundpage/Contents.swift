  You can probably easily recongize those numbers above. We has humans can do this everyday, at any moment accuractly. Imagine if we can create a program that can allow computers to do the same. This problems seems simple, "Neil, we are just telling the machines to read 10 numbers!". 
 
 After a couple of decades of machine learning research, sciencetist came to the suprising conclusion that it's extremely difficult to do this. Scientist in the past often ended up with tens of thousands of lines of code for computer vision, which is hard to maintain and limited to certain cases. 
 
- Important: What humans can do easily is difficult for machine, tasks that are hard for us is relatively simple for machines. This is better known as the Moravec's Paradox.

 How do we solve problems such as recognizing handwriting or natural language processing? Today, we will create a neural network in Swift that can recognize handwritten digits.

 Our brain is made out of gizzilons of neurals. Parts of the neural take in inforamtion, process them and return some output. After hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, our human brain became one of the most complex and beautiful creation of the universe.
